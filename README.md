# 2d-Ray-Caster
2d Ray Caster developed with Python and pygame.

The project was inspired by this [video by The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOEi6T2mtHo&t=1251s). I also used this [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93line_intersection) for all the calculations.
